# PPLForge
Enhancing the HPP Language

## What is PPLForge?

PPLForge is under-developing translator which provide a way to translate your C code into the PPL language running on HP Prime calculator. 

We use LLVM as the compiler API, in theory, you can convert any program language to PPL if only it has a reliable LLVM front end.

PPLForge is still under developing, but it will soon be released, everything about programing is going fine.
